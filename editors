     * Most editors support two different operation when accepting a completion item. One is to insert a
     * completion text and the other is to replace an existing text with a completion text. Since this can
     * usually not predetermined by a server it can report both ranges. Clients need to signal support for
     * `InsertReplaceEdits` via the `textDocument.completion.insertReplaceSupport` client capability
     * property.
     *
     * *Note 1:* The text edit's range as well as both ranges from a insert replace edit must be a
     * [single line] and they must contain the position at which completion has been requested.
     * *Note 2:* If an `InsertReplaceEdit` is returned the edit's insert range must be a prefix of
     * the edit's replace range, that means it must be contained and starting at the same position.
     *
     * @since 3.16.0 additional type `InsertReplaceEdit`
